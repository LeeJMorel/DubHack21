            <p>During the pandemic, many communities became unable to communicate due to misinformation and the loss in person connection.
                Conversations became to difficult to continue, people stopped talking, and many lost communication entirely.
                
                 We created an app that helps these conversations move forward in a healthy way, and keep friends, families, and communities supporting each other. 
                 Pomi features various tools to help people identify and communicate their feelings in healthy and supportive ways.
                
                With Pomi you can:
                Set limits for when you will recieve messages
                “Take a Break” if the conversation get difficult, pause and come back at any time
                Pomi has built in moderation tools - keeping the focus on communication
                Identify emotions and learn new ways to communicate with each other
